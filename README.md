# json_parser _[wip]_

## About
This is a personal exercise to do some more Rust.
It should result in a simple JSON parser, *not intended for any production use*. 

## Goals
- parse JSON
- re-convert structure to JSON
- maybe some other useful function, e.g. converting PHP serialized data to 
  JSON or vice versa.

## Currently WIP
- Structuring the project in a Rust-y way
- Creating a lib

## Help
If you want to help me or give some advice, feel free to
create issues or PRs.
