# json_parser [wip]

## About
This is a personal exercise to do some more Rust.
It should result in a simple parser for JSON data, not 
intended for any production use. 

## Goals
- mandatory: Parse JSON
- optional: Re-convert structure to JSON

# Help
If you want to help me or give some advice, feel free to
create issues or PRs.
