# json_parser _[wip]_

## About
This is a personal exercise to do some more Rust.
It should result in a simple JSON parser, *not intended for any production use*. 

## Goals
- parse JSON
- re-convert structure to JSON

## Currently WIP
- Handling of special string chars (e.g. backticks, utf-8, emojis)

## Help
If you want to help me or give some advice, feel free to
